# Hiragana
 A simple clean and elegant hiragana practice website written in JS and CSS.

## Motivation
Back in 2017 I started to code this project for myself, the main purpose was to learn more about Javascript and CSS. Also I like japanese stuffs, so why not making a hiragana memorizing website?

## Usage
Just type in the textbox, earn points and see how much you match or miss. Simple.
