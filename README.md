# Hiragana practice
 A simple clean and elegant hiragana practice website.

## Usage
Type your guess and earn score (or lose) and track your score ratio.

## Motivation
Back in 2017 I started to code this project for myself, the main purpose was to learn more about Javascript and CSS. Also I like japanese stuffs, so why not making a hiragana memorizing website?
